# Project-Manager-Case-Study

**Company**
A leading North Indian IT Service provider for developing mobile and web apps for clients who manage and trade on digital assets, having ecommerce platform to service huge customer base which are located in the differnt parts of the country. The company specializes developing mobile and web apps and is aggressively looking to expand customer base.

**Challenge**
The company is in the midst of significant business expansion that included onboarding web, ios and android apps for all of its current customers and aggressively looking for new customer in full capacity. Although, they have limited availability of resources across the domain
Web - 1 Senior, 1 Middle Level
IOS - 1 Senior, 1 middle Level
Android - 1 Senior, 1 Middle Level

They are currently have 3 customers which are asking for apps in all the 3 domains and there are multiple leads at various stages for the organisations. The project is currently behind schedule and over budget at the mid-point of the implementation. Remaining on this track would have resulted in the loss of critical clients and associated revenue, along with a significantly reduced return on investment.

At the same time, the company had taken on a new project for Android and IOS App. for a leading global retailer. The addition of this client was projected to double this business unitâ€™s annual volume for the company and required bringing two new call centers online to support the added volume.

In the midst of this transformative growth, senior management wanted to improve overall project management through better monitoring, control, and reporting while ensuring critical deliverables and targets were met.
